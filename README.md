# The Dynamic Cuckoo Filter

## Overview
The Dynamic Cuckoo Filter (DCF) is an efficient approximate membership test data structure. Different from the classic Bloom filter and its variants, DCF is especially designed for highly dynamic dataset and support extending and reducing its capacity. The advantages of DCF are as follows

* The DCF design is the first to achieve both reliable item deletion and flexibly extending/reducing for approximate set representation and membership testing
* DCF outperforms the state-of-the-art DBF design in terms of the capability of reliable item deletion
* A DCF reduces the required memory space of the DBF by 75% as well as improving the speeds of inserting and membership testing by 50% to 80%.

## Structure of DCF

![DCF example](https://github.com/LiangyiLiao/TheDynamicCuckooFilter/blob/master/figure/DCFexample.png)

A DCF leverages CF as building block and consists of a number of s linked homogeneous CFs. The DCF leverages fingerprints
to represent items. Each fingerprints owns two candidate bucket addresses generated by partial-key cuckoo hashing. A DCF achieves dynamic capacity by appending new building blocks and removing empty building blocks generated by compact operation. 

## API
Generate DCF according to the expected maximum item number, expected false positive rate.

```c++
DynamicCuckooFilter* dcf = new DynamicCuckooFilter(config.item_num, config.exp_FPR);
```

The expected building block number of DCF is set to 6 by default and can also be modified as follow

```c++
DynamicCuckooFilter* dcf = new DynamicCuckooFilter(config.item_num, config.exp_FPR, config.exp_BBN);
```


Four operations of DCF: Insert, Query, Delete and Compact

```c++
dcf->insertItem(item) // insert item ,item is a char* format
dcf->queryItem(item)  //query item
dcf->deleteItem(item) //delete item
dcf->compact() //compact DCF
```

## How to use?
### Environment
We implement DCF in a Linux (Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS) with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2430M CPU @2.4GHz and OpenSSL library environment. 

Install OpenSSL (Please refer to https://www.openssl.org to learn more).

```txt
sudo apt-get install openssl
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```
Build and run the example

```txt
cd src/
make test
./test
```


### Configurations
Configurations including false pisitive, item number and dataset path can be costomized in "configuration/config.txt". Change the value after the symbol "=" ONLY!!!

```txt
false positive = 0.02
item number = 1000000
input file path = input/input2.txt
```

### Results
Results are shown in "output/results.txt", including false positive, fingerprint size, building block number, operation time consumed and etc. In the following is the comparison of DCF and DBF when dealing with 1,000,000 items (including insert/query/delete/compact operation).

After transform operation time to speed, the DCF improving the speeds of inserting and membership testing by 50% to 80%.
